	 Constructor method by default annotation if off we need to on it  by above ew bean code
	 <bean id = "deptobj" class = "com.autowire.HRDept"></bean>
	 <bean id = "company" class = "com.autowire.Company" autowire ="constructor"/>
	 -->
	  
	 <!-- it will chcek first by type and than by name so thats why we will put same id as dept in class
	 byName==> (type with refName) using setter method
	 byType ==> (Only Type) using setter method
	 Default ==> by using setter method or by using constructor 
	 <bean id = "dept" class = "com.autowire.HRDept"></bean>
	 <bean id = "company" class = "com.autowire.Company" autowire ="byName"/>
	 
	 
	 <bean id = "dept" class = "com.autowire.HRDept"></bean>
	 <bean id = "company" class = "com.autowire.Company" autowire ="byType"/>
	 
	 Now we are using Autowired and Quilifier
